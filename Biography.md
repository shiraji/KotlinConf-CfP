I (Yoshinori Isogai or shiraji at GitHub) started my career as a Java developer in 2007. From 2015, I began to contribute to Android/iOS libraries and Intellij plugins. When I read PermissionsDispatcher, which is one of best Android runtime permission library, I met Kotlin. Sooner later, I fall in love with Kotlin. Because I really love Kotlin, since July 2016, I have been contributing Kotlin.
