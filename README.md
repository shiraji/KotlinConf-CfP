### Desc of CfP

KotlinConf is a community event to share your experiences using Kotlin, whether these are about putting code into production, finding innovative ways to use Kotlin, challenges you've faced, a framework you've created, or anything you feel you'd like to share that could help others with their journey. 

While the focus of the conference is Kotlin, it does not mean that the talk has to be exclusively focused on the language. Topics we'd love to hear about include:

* Back-end development with Kotlin and JVM
* Front-end development with Kotlin and JavaScript
* Kotlin as a scripting language
* Kotlin in Ops (Build Tools, CI, Monitoring, etc.)
* Kotlin for Android Development
* Kotlin for Plugin Development (IntelliJ IDEA, Gradle, etc.)
* Frameworks and Libraries with Kotlin
* DSL's in Kotlin
* Functional programming with Kotlin
* Concurrent programming with Kotlin
* Reactive Programming with Kotlin
